# Word-Prediction
## Abstract
An intelligent word processing feature that can alleviate writing breakdowns for a range of students by suggesting and completing words based on previous words in the sentence is called word prediction. The best use of word prediction is for students who have difficulty with language, especially for dyslexic students which help them to choose predictions by reducing the number of keystrokes for typing words. <br>
Essentially, word prediction technique can be implemented using two methods, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning algorithm. N- Gram Model, using NLP is an probabilistic method of computing the probability of the nth word based on previous (n-1) words.<br>
The Deep Learning algorithm makes use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). For better results, we will implement an modified version of RNN, that is , Long Short Term Memory Cells for predicting the next word in a sentence employing the use of KERAS API. <br>
